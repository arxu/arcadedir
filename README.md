# arcadedir

Shows directions from current location to an arcade I like.  
  
Uses Geolocation, Google Maps JavaScript and Google Maps Directions APIs.  
  
To use, place on a server or web app and access through a modern browser.
  
The file should work as long as it's not accessed through a file:/// link.  
  
Tested working with MAMP and JSFiddle.
